S3 vs EFS vs EBS
Why did AWS build three storage services instead of just one?

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Stores data as objects, not traditional files or disks.
Typically accessed using APIs (HTTP/SDKs) instead of a traditional file system.
Best for user uploads, photos, videos, PDFs, backups, logs, and static website assets.

Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
A fully managed shared file system.
Multiple EC2 instances can mount the same file system at the same time.
Best when multiple application servers need access to the same files.

Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
Provides persistent block storage for Amazon EC2.
Typically attached to a single EC2 instance.
Commonly used for operating systems, databases, and application storage.

Object Storage → Amazon S3
Shared File Storage (Among EC2 Instance) → Amazon EFS
Block Storage → Amazon EBS
